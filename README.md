# Introduction
This repo contains short demos for CNN and LLM deployment on AMD Ryzen AI PCs for those interested in learning how to use these tools on AMD AI PCs. The quantized CNN models and Lemonade hosted LLMs will tap into the computing power of the on board NPUs to provide higher inference speeds and lower power consumption.

# Prerequisites 
To run these samples, the following must be installed:
- [Ryzen AI 1.5.0](https://ryzenai.docs.amd.com/en/latest/inst.html)
- Cmake
- Visual Studio 2022
- For the LLM applications, either [Ollama](https://ollama.com/download) or [Lemonade Server](https://lemonade-server.ai/docs/server/) needs to be installed.

# Usage
Unless otherwise stated, all code in this repo can be run by calling python <filename.py> without additional arguments. For more information, feel free to check out the included slides.
